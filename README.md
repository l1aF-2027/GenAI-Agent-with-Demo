# GenAI Agent Demo Journey

## 🙌 Acknowledgement & Inspiration

This project is **inspired by [GenAI\_Agents](https://github.com/NirDiamant/GenAI_Agents/tree/main)** created by **Nir Diamant** 🌟.
It’s an amazing collection of tutorials and examples for building Generative AI agents, ranging from beginner conversational bots to advanced multi-agent systems.

💡 **Big shout-out to Nir Diamant** for sharing such a valuable resource with the community!

## 🎯 Project Goals

* 🛠 **Backend foundation** → Built on **FastAPI**, following patterns from the reference repo.
* 🌱 **Simple functional demo (V0)** → A minimal conversational agent with context-awareness.
* 📚 **Learning-first approach** → As I’m not a frontend expert, the UI will be kept simple, focusing on core agent behavior.
